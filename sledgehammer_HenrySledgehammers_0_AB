an ode to John Henry from an Ogun 0.

Two twin 20lb sledgehammers with a semi transparent red tops

One with a green tiger striped handle.

The other with a marine blue handle

Materials: unknown but that top is important. Cloudy too even though thats usually a bad sign in the jewelry world right?

They should be the sledgehammer most suited for long term extreme use as if John Henry asked before his famous competition.
